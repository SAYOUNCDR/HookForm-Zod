# React Hook Form + Zod (TypeScript Practice)

This repository contains my practice code while learning **form handling** in React using [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) and **type-safe validation** with [Zod](https://zod.dev/).

The goal of this repo is to understand how to build forms in React that are:
- âœ… Type-safe (powered by TypeScript + Zod)  
- âœ… Performant (React Hook Form avoids unnecessary re-renders)  
- âœ… Easy to validate (no duplicate validation logic)

## ðŸš€ Tech Stack
- **React** (with Vite for fast dev environment)  
- **TypeScript** (strong typing)  
- **React Hook Form** (form handling)  
- **Zod** (schema validation)  
- **@hookform/resolvers** (bridge between RHF and Zod)
